Main
----
Create Gem scaffolding for project.
Create an executable with some basic CLI func.
Unit test all functionality.

Other
-----
Add logging functionality (possibly use the mongo logger).
Think about potentially updating the crawler (main.rb) to be multi threaded.

Issues
------
If you crawl a base url and there is a link to its index file a duplicate doc
gets crawled and inserted into the DB because the base url and base/index point
to the same document.  One solution is to insert the doc html into the DB and
setup a unique index on the html field so the duplication will be picked up 
during the insert and the second doc won't be inserted.  This is potentially 
inefficient as the duplicate url is still crawled but at least the doc won't
be saved to the DB and therefore won't result in a duplicate search result.
