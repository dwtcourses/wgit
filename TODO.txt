Main
----
Unit test all functionality.
Create a RoR app for the search engine front end.
Create an executable with some basic CLI func.

Other
-----
Find out how to run built in tests on an installed gem?
Think about how we store DB connection details, is it right?
Put all classes in a single module called Pinch e.g. Pinch::Url etc. - See 
MiniTest documentation for a similar example.  This prevents naming conflicts. 
Add logging functionality (possibly use the mongo logger).
Think about potentially updating the crawler (main.rb) to be multi threaded.

Issues
------
If you crawl a base url and there is a link to its index file a duplicate doc
gets crawled and inserted into the DB because the base url and base/index point
to the same document.  One solution is to insert the doc html into the DB and
setup a unique index on the html field so the duplication will be picked up 
during the insert and the second doc won't be inserted.  This is potentially 
inefficient as the duplicate url is still crawled but at least the doc won't
be saved to the DB and therefore won't result in a duplicate search result.
