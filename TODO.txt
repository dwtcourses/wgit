Primary
-------
- Have the option to follow redirects and then update README & code refs.
- Update Database#search & Document#search to have optional case sensitivity.
- Have the ability to crawl sub sections of a site only e.g. https://www.honda.co.uk/motorcycles.html as the base url and crawl any links containing this as a prefix. For example, https://www.honda.co.uk/cars.html would not be crawled but https://www.honda.co.uk/motorcycles/africa-twin.html would be.
- Create an executable based on the ./bin/console shipped as `wpry`.

Secondary
---------
- Think about ignoring non html documents/urls e.g. http://server/image.jpg etc.
- Check if Document::TEXT_ELEMENTS is expansive enough.
- Add logging functionality (possibly use the mongo logger?).
- Possibly use refine instead of core-ext?
- Think about potentially updating the Indexer to be multi threaded.
- Think about potentially using DB._update's update_many func.

Refactoring
-----------
- Mock network calls (at least many of them) in tests.
- Remove STDOUT ruby warnings from console and test output.

Gem Publishing Checklist
------------------------
- Ensure a clean branch of master.
- Run 'bundle exec rake compile' and ensure no warnings/errors.
- Run 'bundle exec rake test' and ensure all tests are passing.
- Increment the version number (in version.rb).
- Run `bundle exec yardoc` to update documentation.
- Run `bundle exec rake install` to build and install the gem locally, then test it manually from outside this repo.
- Run `bundle exec rake RELEASE[origin]` to tag, build and push the gem to rubygems.org.
- Push new commit tag to Github.com with `git push --tags`.
