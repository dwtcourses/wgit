Primary
-------
Have the option to follow redirects and then update README & code refs.
Update Database#search & Document#search to have optional case sensitivity.
Create an executable with some basic CLI func.

Secondary
---------
Think about ignoring non html documents/urls e.g. http://server/image.jpg etc.
Check if Document::TEXT_ELEMENTS is expansive enough.
Remove CONNECTION_DETAILS and read in values from the ENV.
Add logging functionality (possibly use the mongo logger?).
Possibly use refine instead of core-ext?
Think about potentially updating the Indexer to be multi threaded.
Think about potentially using DB._update's update_many func.

Refactoring
-----------
Mock network calls (at least most of them) in tests.
Add TOC to `README.md`.
Use Utils#each where possible across project.
Use super if possible when overriding getter and setters.
Append '.freeze' to all constants where they shouldn't be changed.
Sort tab formatting to be consistent throughout (with 2 space tabs).

Gem Publishing Checklist
------------------------
Run 'rake compile' and ensure no warnings/errors.
Run 'rake test' and ensure all tests are passing.

Remove the DB authentication details - VERY IMPORTANT!
Run `yard` to update documentation.
Build gem from `gemspec`, install and test it manually.
